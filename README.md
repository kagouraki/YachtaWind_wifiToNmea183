# YachtaWind_wifiToNmea183
esp8266 Wifi to Nmea183 converter

This board and firmware is just a nmea183 repeater. It sends all nmea it recieves from a wifi tcp server to the wired Nmea183 devices. It has two wired nmea183 outputs. 
At some point i will write a guide how to use it and understand the leds.  Until then if you have questions open a discussion. 
It is build to recieve the nmea stream from original Norbert Walter's yachta wind sensor project. 
I made some minor modifications to the pcb, 3dprinted parts and software. You can find everything in my gitlab repos.

Thank you

G.
